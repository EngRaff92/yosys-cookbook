# Yosys Cookbook

This is intended to be a user-friendly guide to the synthesis options of Yosys, since I think they could be better described.

Currently, there are pages on:
- [Lattice iCE40](ice40.md)
- [Lattice ECP5](ecp5.md)
- [Intel Cyclone V](cyclone_v.md)

There is also a miscellaneous page on why I suggest [ABC9](misc/abc9.md) for ECP5 and use it exclusively for Cyclone V.
